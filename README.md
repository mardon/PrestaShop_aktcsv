[Warnings]
- BACKUP YOUR DATABASE FIRST! Preferably using outside tools such as mysqldump
Then examine the backup file - does it look like it holds all your data??
- Turn on MAINTENANCE MODE. You don't want customers confusing things.
- TEST IT THOROUGHLY. If you are not convinced everything is right, restore from your backup!
